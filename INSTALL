*** API USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
********************************************************************************

Webthumb used a simple REST/HTTP API for fetching thumbnails. You simply fetch a
URL with an encoded target URL of the site you wish to thumbnail.  This
information is then passed via CGI to Mozilla which renders the thumbnail.
You'll have to follow 302 redirects since we save the thumbnail to the
filesystem and serve it from there.

To render a thumbnail:

1. Create an HTTP request to

    http://webthumb.example.com/cgi-bin/webthumb.cgi

    with a 'resource' URL parameter of the site you wish to thumbnail.

    For exmple:

    http://webthumb.example.com/cgi-bin/webthumb.cgi?resource=http://cnn.com

    Would create a thumbnail to for CNN.

    You can also go to:

    http://webthumb.example.com/cgi-bin/webthumb.cgi

    which will then generate a form for you to enter any arbitrary URL for
    testing.

    Obviously example.com should change to your domain name.

    You should also be able to use standard HTTP authentication via Apache if
    your HTTP library supports this.

2.  Fetch the resulting image and save it with any mechanism you'd like.  You
    can also serve the image right from the webthumb server if you'd like. 

********************************************************************************
*** CONFIGURATION 
********************************************************************************

The main configuration parameter is the number of Mozilla processes you need to
run.  The more processes the faster you can render thumbnails.  This is set with
the INSTANCE_COUNT variable in /etc/init.d/webthumb and
/usr/lib/cgi-bin/webthumb.cgi.  Both of these need to be the same value.

Note that each Mozilla process takes from 10-15M of memory so if you set this
value too high you'll start to page which will slow down the machine.

The webthumb.cgi script contains internal parameters including thumbnail size.
You could edit these to adjust the size of the generated thumbnail.  You might
also need to change these values if running under a Linux distribution other
than Debian.

If Flash is necessary simply following the instructions for Mozilla should allow
it to automatically work with webthumb.

Note that for security purposes Javascript has been disabled by default. You can
edit the default prefs.js file to re-enable javascript if necessary.  

********************************************************************************
*** INSTALL  INSTRUCTIONS
********************************************************************************

- Create the webthumb directory on the local webserver.  This will be used to
  store the rendered thumbnails.  If your webserver used a document root other
  than /var/www you'll have to edit the webthumb.cgi file to adjust the file
  serving location.

    /var/www/webthumb

- Install mozilla and XVfb

    apt-get install mozilla-browser
    apt-get install xvfb

- Install imagemagik.  This is used to resize the resulting thumbnails.

    apt-get install imagemagick

- install fonts

    apt-get install ttf-bitstream-vera

    # NOTE: is xserver-common avail on Debian?

    apt-get install xserver-common 

    apt-get install xfonts-base \
                    xfonts-100dpi \
                    xfonts-75dpi \
                    xfonts-scalable \
                    xbase-clients \
                    xfonts-pex

    This is IMPORTANT because it won't have problems until months later:
                    
    http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts/
                    
                    
- install tools (used for calculating image size)

    apt-get install bc


    
- install apache

    apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork
    
- Startup Mozilla and XVfb and start in startup

    cp 
    ln -s 

- Setup filesystem

      mkdir /var/www/webthumb
      chgrp -R www-data /var/www/webthumb
      chmod -R g+w /var/www/webthumb/

- Setup Mozilla

    - mkdir -p /root/.mozilla/default/

    - Copy the src/mozilla-profile directory into

       /root/.mozilla/default/

       This is used to set preferences and so forth.  A unique copy is created
       for each Mozilla process.
       
    - copy en-US.jar and replace the version that ships with Mozilla.  This
      includes a few settings to disable dialog prompts which we don't want
      showing up in the resulting thumbnail.

- make sure 'import' and 'convert' are installed and in the PATH.  These are
  installed by Imagemagick and are required to resize the images.
  
- Install the src/cgi/webthumb*.cgi scripts into /usr/lib/cgi-bin

- Install the src/startup-scripts/webthumb scripts into /etc/init.d and make it
  executable.

 * I need to figure out a way to get true type fonts installed.
