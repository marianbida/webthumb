    - Write a quick unit test that fetches a bunch of blogs with 10 thread and
      saves their thumbnails to disk for verification. 

    - FIXME: determine the XServer Id from the lock ID 
      
    - DISABLE SSL WARNINGS ... see ssl-warning.jpg

    - If for some reason Mozilla (or the x-server) fails... we need to restart.
      This should probably be with a crontab ...

        - The crontab should just:

            - Shutdown Apache (which is probably not a good idea on a multi-user box)
            - Shutdown webthumb
            - Remove all the tmp files.
            - Startup webthumb.
            
    - find script that deletes older files...

    - Enter username and password for 

    - "The operation timed out when attempting to contact"

    - Enable a DEBUG mode so that I can preserve the ORIGINAL thumbnail for
      later debug.

    - Make SURE Mozilla isn't running on the same X server.

        .lock file symlinks to the process id.
    
    - Do NOT run Mozilla or Xvfb as root... run them as 'webthumb'.

        - Create a FULL init script for this.

    - Write a script which pings the system and makes 100% sure it's working.
      Send off an email if not.

    - Install on test.sofari.com

*** SECONDARY ISSUES ***

- #FIXME: make this string easier to recognize and grep MUST for it to
  #prevent another page loading resulting in a correct thumbnail.

    For example if we ask to load http://www.boingboing.net it might say it loaded

        http://boingboing.net/ (without the www and with a trailing /)

        This MIGHT be the most elegent approach because of 302 redirects.

- Disable javascript in the browser and all the options.

- find and delete crontab to delete older thumbnails.
