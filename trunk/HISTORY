    Javascript disabled.    

- CORRECT URL decoding.  What are ALL the rules?!

- No popups for software install in Mozilla

- If the lock file is REALLY old we should delete it.  But HOW do we do this?

    removeStaleLock needs to be called BEFORE and within makeLock 

- startup script cleanup...    

- FIXME: we NEED to pay attention to

    Error loading URL http://www.cnn.com/

    vs

    Document about:blank loaded successfully

- Increase the INTERVAL to something like .1 seconds.  the problem is that eval
  can't add real numbers

- we lock to make sure multiple requests don't happen at once

- We need standard error handling in the CGI

- The script seems to sleep FOREVER since the .1 upgrade.

- The homepage in the startup script should be set to about:blank

    user_pref("browser.startup.homepage", "about:blank");
